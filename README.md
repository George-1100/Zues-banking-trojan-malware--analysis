# Zues-banking-trojan-malware--analysis
# Objective of this Project
Perform Static and Dynamic malware analysis against Zeus banking trojon 
# About the Zeus malware
Zeus also acts as a financial services Trojan designed to steal banking credentials from the machines it infects. It accomplishes this through website monitoring and keylogging, where the malware recognizes when the user is on a banking website and records the keystrokes used to log in. This means that the Trojan can get around the security in place on these websites, as the keystrokes required for logging in are recorded as the user enters them.

# Tools that i used for this project
FLARE VM is a collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily setup and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine 

1. VirusTotal
   A free, online services which analyzes files and URLs for viruses and 
  other types of malicious content. Used to flag malicious files and 
  programs.

2. PE Studio
   This program used to statically analyze malware identify artifacts of 
   interest
   * Hashes
   * File header
   * file properties
   * strings (IP address, URL, File Hashes)
   * libraries used
   * imports
3. Floss
   * Extract srings from executebles
   * Used advanced static analysis technique to automatically                 deobfuscate from malware binaries
  
4. Capa
   * Automatically detect capablities of program and outputs what it          thinks it can the program can do
   * Rules are matched againt Known API calls identified, strings of          interest(for example a rule may be "connect to URL")
   * Behaviour is mapped to the MITTRE ATT&CK framework

5.  Cutter
   * Revrse-engineering platform
   * used to view assembly-level instructions of programs
   * view decompiled code
6. INetSim
   * Software suite used for simulating common internet services
   * Can be used to analyze the network behavior for malware samples
   * Support simulate for many services
     HTTP, SMPTP, DNS, NTP, Syslog

7. Wireshark
   Network packet sniffer and analyzer. Used for network troubleshooting    and packet analysis

8. Process Monitor
   Monitor and displays realtime information on the windows filesystem
   * Registry
   * Filesystem
   * Processes
   * profilling Events
  Used to capture malicious activity occurring on filesystem. 

   9. Used to classify and identify malware samples by creating rules of       malware families based on binary patterns
